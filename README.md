1)Bubble Sort-Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It is called bubble sort because the smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list, while the larger elements "sink" to the bottom. The algorithm proceeds by iterating through the list of elements, comparing each pair of adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are necessary, indicating that the list is sorted. Although bubble sort is simple to understand and implement, it has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), making it relatively inefficient for large lists. For this reason, it is usually only used for small lists or as an educational example of a sorting algorithm.

2)Insertion Sort-Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly taking an unsorted element and inserting it into the correct position in a sorted sub-list. It is particularly efficient for small data sets and nearly sorted lists. The algorithm proceeds by starting with a single element (the first element) and iterating through the list, comparing each subsequent element with the elements in the sorted sub-list and inserting it into the correct position. The sorted sub-list grows with each iteration until all elements have been inserted and the list is fully sorted. Insertion sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), making it relatively inefficient for large data sets. However, it has the advantage of being simple to understand and implement, and it performs well on small or nearly sorted lists. Additionally, insertion sort is often used as part of more complex sorting algorithms, such as merge sort or quicksort.
